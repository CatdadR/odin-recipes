# odin-recipes
odin html page assignment

Goal of assignment
to use prior lessons in the foundation course covering the basics of html tags and using github along with commit notes. 
in this assignment I will be creating a website which will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
this site is to be created through HTML and using the basic tags the odin project has so far covered.
